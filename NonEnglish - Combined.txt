no offence, but using an online translator when it isn't even necessary sort of indicates the level of discussion one is capable of.. 
I don't need "compliments" from some1 who knows 0 about rap & is dumb enough to use an online translator to talk to an English speaker. Stfu 
So feel free to write in ENG:) In fact i get feedback from non-Russian speakers almost every day ‚úåÔ∏èÔøΩ only thing I don't like is ignorant ppl 
I spoke against @HillaryClinton's anti-Russia rhetorics and discussed my film Black Rose on @KABCRadio. Big thanks to my friend @briancalle!

DEVILS GOT MY SOUL TEASER: 
no offence, but using an online translator when it isn't even necessary sort of indicates the level of discussion one is capable of.. 
I was about to ask "how on earth is the U.S. scene worthless if it has 1000's of dope artists?", then i read your other rants.. No more q's 
So feel free to write in ENG:) In fact i get feedback from non-Russian speakers almost every day ‚úåÔ∏èÔøΩ only thing I don't like is ignorant ppl 
I don't need "compliments" from some1 who knows 0 about rap & is dumb enough to use an online translator to talk to an English speaker. Stfu 
I spoke against @HillaryClinton's anti-Russia rhetorics and discussed my film Black Rose on @KABCRadio. Big thanks to my friend @briancalle!
